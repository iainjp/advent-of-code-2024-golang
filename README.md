# advent-of-code-2024-golang
Golang solutions for Advent Of Code 2024.

Note: checking in the inputs is frowned upon, so they are being removed. It means this repo won't work out-the-box.

To run:
- `cd` to the day folder
- add the puzzle input as input.txt, and input_test.txt for tests.
- run tests with `go test -v`
- run solution with `go run solution.go`
